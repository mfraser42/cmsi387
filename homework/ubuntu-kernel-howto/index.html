        <h1> Building, Installing, and Modifying the Ubuntu 13.10 Kernel </h1>
        <h4> Michael Fraser, Loyola Marymount University </h4>
        
        <h2> Prerequisites </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Computer or virtual machine running a version of Ubuntu similar to the version you wish to build. </li>
            <li> The following packages should be present with your version of Ubuntu:
                <ul> 
                    <li> git </li>
                    <li> make </li>
                    <li> dpkg </li>
                    <li> a text editor, such as gedit </li>
                </ul> 
            </li>
            <li> The following packages do not come with Ubuntu and need to be installed separately: 
                <ul> 
					<li> fakeroot </li>
					<li> build-essential </li>
					<li> devscripts </li>
					<li> libncurses5 </li>
					<li> libncurses5-dev </li>
                    <li> kernel-package </li>
                </ul> 
            </li>
            <li> A connection to the internet </li>
            <li> Root privileges </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2> Step 1: Get the Kernel Source </h2>
        <p> Ubuntu sources to different Linux Kernels are maintained at ubuntu.kernel.org. 
			In your terminal, move to a desired location into which you will download the kernel source. 
			Then run the following command, which is specific to Ubuntu Trusty (13.10): 
		</p>
        <code> git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-trusty.git </code>.
        <p> The same command can be altered for different versions of Ubuntu in the following manner: </p>
        <code> git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-&#60;version&#62;.git </code>,
        <p> where <code>&#60;version&#62;</code> is the name of the desired ubuntu version, such as trusty, oneiric, etc. 
			This source will be downloaded into a directory according to the name of the Ubuntu version, and in the case of Ubuntu Trusty, 
			a directory called <code> ubuntu-trusty </code> will be created. You now have the kernel source! 
		</p>
        
        <h2> Step 2: Setup the Build Environment</h2>
        <p> If you have not built a kernel on your current system previously, there are necessary packages to install 
			before the kernel can be built. If you have built a kernel on your system before, you can skip this step. 
			Running the following code will install the dependent packages if you are planning to build a kernel version 
			similar to your current system's version: 
		</p>
        <code> sudo apt-get build-dep linux-image-$(uname -r) </code>.
        
        <h2> Step 3: Build the Plain Kernel! </h2>
        <p> If this is your first time building and installing a kernel, you will want to familiarize yourself with the 
			process before making any modifications to the source. Building the kernel is easy enough, but can 
			take quite a while so make sure your computer will have time to run uninterrupted. Change your terminal 
			location to the root of the kernel source, <code> ubuntu-trusty </code>, and run the following commands: 
		</p>
        <code> fakeroot debian/rules clean, and <br />
               fakeroot debian/rules binary-headers binary-generic 
        </code>.
        <p> The first command will clean the package tree and ready it for proper building. The second command will 
			initialize the build process. This will take a while, and if the build is successful you will find at 
			least 3 .deb binary package files in the directory outside the root of the kernel source. To check if 
			the files exist, navigate up a level and list all files with a .deb extension: 
		</p>
        <code> cd ... <br />
               ls *.deb <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;linux-headers-3.13.0-13_3.13.0-13.33_all.deb <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;linux-headers-3.13.0-13-generic_3.13.0-13.33_i386.deb <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;linux-image-3.13.0-13-generic_3.13.0-13.33_i386.deb <br /> 
        </code> 
        <p> There may be a couple extra .deb files produced as well, which contain some additional features for the kernel.
			The extra .deb files that were produced in this example were:
		</p>            
		<code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; linux-image-extra-3.13.0-13-generic_3.13.0-13.33_i386.deb<br />
			   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; linux-tools-3.13.0-13-generic_3.13.0-13.33_i386.deb
		</code>
        
        <h2> Step 4: Install and Test the New Kernel </h2>
		<p> To install the new kernel from the .deb files, run the following command: </p>
        <code> sudo dpkg -i linux-*3.13.0-13*.deb </code>,
		<p> which specifically targets .deb files corresponding to the version that was just built. This process takes a short while,
			but nowhere nearly as long as the build process did (should complete in under 10 minutes, but it depends on your system).
			To test the new kernel, reboot the computer, and it will start up with the new version!
		</p>
		
		<h2> **Create Your Own System Call** </h2>
		<p> Next we will be taking the source code that we downloaded in step 1
			and we will be modifying the source code to add our own system call!
		</p>
		<h2> Step 5: Adding the New System Call to the System Call Table </h2>
		<p> To have our system call be recognized by the system, we need to modify
			the system call table and add our system call to it. The file we need 
			to modify is 
		</p> 
		<code class="codeclass"> ubuntu-trusty/arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl </code> (for 32-bit kernels).
		<p> To this file, we need to append the following line: </p>
		<code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;351 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i386 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			sys_helloworld &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sys_helloworld </code>.
		<p> The number above, 351, may vary depending on your system. In should be 1 higher than
			the max of the system call numbers in the file. 
		</p>
        <h2> Step 6: Adding the System Call to the Syscall Interface Header </h2>
		<p> Adding the new system call to this header allows multiple programs to utilize
			the new system call. The file to be modified is <code> include/linux/syscalls.h </code> 
			To this file, we must append the following line:
		</p>
		<code> asmlinkage long sys_helloworld(void) </code>.
		<p> The void <code> input </code> type allows the system to understand that the system call requires no inputs. </p>
                    
        <h2> Step 7: Adding the System Call to the Makefile </h2>  
		<p> Here we must modify the Makefile found in the root directory of the kernel source, and change one line from </p>
		<code> kernel/ mm/ fs/ ipc/ security/ crypto/ block/ </code> to
		<code> kernel/ mm/ fs/ ipc/ security/ crypto/ block/ helloworld/ </code>.
		
		<h2> Step 8: Creating the Source File for the System Call </h2>
		<p> Now that the system knows of the system call, will attempt to compile the call during the build, and programs will
			have pointers to the system call once the new kernel is installed, we should actually write the system call. In the 
			home directory of the kernel source, create a folder called <code> helloworld </code>. Then create a file called
			<code> helloworld.c </code>, and copy the very basic version of the "Hello World" output to the kernel log file provided: 
		</p>
		<code> #include <linux/kernel.h> <br /> <br />
			
			asmlinkage long sys_helloworld(void) { <br /> 
				
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printk("Hello world.\n"); <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return 0; <br />
			}
		</code>
		<p> To ensure this basic system call is compiled, create a makefile in that same <code> helloworld </code> directory, and 
			add the following line: 
		</p>
		<code> obj-y := helloworld.o </code>.
               
        <h2> Step 9: Build, Install, and Test the New System Call </h2>
        <p> Repeat steps 3 and 4 to rebuild and test the Kernel. To test the system call, create the file <code> helloworld.c </code> and 
            copy the following function into it: 
        </p>
        <code>  
            #include &#60;stdio.h&#62; <br />
            #include &#60;linux/kernel.h&#62; <br />
            #include &#60;sys/syscall.h&#62; <br />
            #include &#60;unistd.h&#62;  <br /> <br />

            long helloworld_syscall(void) {<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return syscall(351);<br />
            }<br /><br />

            int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long int a = helloworld_syscall();<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("System call returned %ld\n", a);<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 0;<br />
            }
        </code>
        <p> Compile the file and run the produced executable. The program should return a 0, and should print the message "Hello, World" to the kernel log,
            which can be viewed by running the <code> dmesg </code> command.
            
        <h2> Celebrate! </h2>
        <p> You've now accomplished one of the <strike> most annoying</strike> most fun tasks of operating systems! </p>
